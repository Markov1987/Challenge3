# Challenge3 - Election Audit


## Project Overview
We received the following tasks to complete an election audit for a Colorado Board of Elections: 

1) Calculate the total number of votes. 
2) Get a complete list of candidates. 
3) Calculate the total number and percentage of votes received per candidate. 
4) Determine winner based on simple majority mechanism. 

Additionally, we performed a few additional computations directed to understand voters distribution among the counties:

1) Count vote turnout per county.
2) Identify the largest turnout. 


## Resources Used
To accurately perform the requested analysis we used  the election results basis provided by the Board (election_results.csv) and process the information with Python:

## Results

Total votes at the election added to almost 370 k, voters decided among 3 candidates: 

1) Charles Casper Stockham.
2) Diana DeGette.
3) Raymon Anthony Doana. 

After considering the basis of the total votes, distribution between candidates ended as follows:

Thus, Miss Diana DeGette won the election by getting over 70% of the total computed votes:

Per county votes analysis showed an important concentration being Denver the largest county accounting for over 80% of the total turnout:
